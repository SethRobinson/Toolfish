What's new in V2.10 (June 28th, 2021)

* Fixed instant crash on startup that happened when it tried to figure out its real IP address, HTTP 0.9 requests are no longer accepted these days I guess
* Installer now installs to %LocalAppData%\toolfish, it no longer requires admin privileges
* Added "$CLIPBOARD_URL$" dynamic token, it formats whatever is in your clipboard without the http:// or https:// part. This let me open a URL
with VLC and have it work, as the http:// part as a parm (to load a movie url) would screw it up before

Note:  If you're upgrading and don't want to lose events you've made, you'll need to copy the old ones from
Program Files (x86)\Toolfish\events to %LocalAppData%\toolfish\events

* Event viewer now shows the exact time until it will be run (if applicable)


What's new in V2.04 build c (September 24th, 2004)

* Added "Reverse mode" operation to site monitor function, this way you can perform an operation if
  a site is UP rather than just if it is down. (useful for ftp'ing 'online/offline' jpgs)
* Added logon/password web authentication support to file compares, this way I can use Toolfish to update my dynamic
  ZoneEdit account every ten minutes.  (the new options are on the WebCompare dialog)
* The URL used for web compares and site checks is now fully 'token aware', you can use things like
  $IP_ADDRESS$ and it will be able to accurately send your current IP address in a URL.
* F1 now brings up help instead of showing an error message

What's new in V2.03 build b (August 22nd, 2004)

What's new in V2.02 build a (December 8th, 2003)

* The Send Command To App event now supports sending a SPACE to an app (before this was missing from the list)
* Fixed obscure crash related to using the "Enable/disable text to speech" option from the tray bar
* Day filters are now checked against the time the event was scheduled to run, (if there was a time trigger) rather than
  when it actually did run.  Makes them behave more like you would expect. 
* WebCompare tweaked: Now even 1 byte changes will register a 1% change, rather than
  0.2% or so which wouldn't get triggered, as 1% was the minimum you could set it for.
  (thanks to Mark Fassett for this one)
* Button graphics no longer sometimes load with glitches, special thanks to David Calabro for
  the fix
