Toolfish also supports easy to use hotkeys, macros (including paste IP address), scheduling reminders or programs to be run, keyboard logging (with stealth mode) and muting on inactivity.

Use the Add URL Wizard to add sites quick and easy or get down and dirty with the event builder and create custom events with unlimited triggers and actions.
